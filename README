RTLabel - rich text formatting based on html-like markups for iOS. 

RTLabel works like UILabel, but supports html-like markups for rich text display. 
It is based on Core Text, so it supports some of the stuff that Core Text supports

* bold and italic style
* color and size
* stroke
* indenting
* kerning
* line spacing
* clickable links

The code is still messy, but it's usable. But I have only fixed bugs that is crucial to my projects, so if you are using this, do fork it and push back the fixes. 
Thanks
